# About

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Economics at Shiv Nadar University, Delhi NCR, India. I hold an MPhil in economics from Visva-Bharati University. Previously, I worked as a Research Associate in Sambodhi Research & Communications Pvt Ltd. 
My academic endeavors have cultivated a strong interest in development economics, particularly in understanding the impact of structural inequalities, such as caste discrimination, on economic outcomes.
