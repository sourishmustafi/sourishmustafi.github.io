# About

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Economics at Shiv Nadar University, Delhi NCR, India. I hold a MPhil in economics from Visva-Bharati University. Previously, I worked as a Research Associate in Sambodhi Research & Communications Pvt Ltd. 
My research is in development economics, with a focus on the effects of conflict and structural inequalities on human capital formation. I study how exposure to violence, institutional responses, and social hierarchies—such as caste—shape long-run educational and labor market outcomes, using applied microeconometric methods and administrative data.
